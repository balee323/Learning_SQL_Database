DB Design steps:

Optional: Write all the stuff that is associated with the system you are building.
Just list it out and organize on ERD.

1. Entity-relationship diagram (ERD)	
	a. All entities as squares
	b. Add all fields as circles (connect with lines)
	c. Action is Diamond
	d. Connect entities as together with lines
	e. One-to-One, one-to-many, and Many-to-Many relationships (optional and mandatory)


2. Entities become DB Tables

3. Normalization:   https://www.guru99.com/database-normalization.html
NORMALIZATION is a database design technique that organizes tables in a manner that reduces redundancy
and dependency of data. Normalization divides larger tables into smaller tables and links them using 
relationships.

	a. Each row of data must single piece of data (each record must be unique).  1NF
	b. Decompose Tables based on Primary keys.  2NF
	c. Link tables using foreign keys (primary keys in origin table)  2NF
	d. There can be no dependencies. All things must be decomposed.  3NF
	

4. Create the tables on Paper.
	a. Table names with primary keys
	b. Field names with Data types
	c. Link tables using foreign keys
	d. optionally: Add cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many)


5. Create the physical tables on DBMS (Database Management System)
	a. Have SQL server Express installed  
		https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads
		Install as named instance (SQLDev), and use Integrated Security for Login.
	b. Have SQL Server Management Studio installed
